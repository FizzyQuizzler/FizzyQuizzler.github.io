							Programming:: <br>
								These days I am far and away from the programming language that I started with. When I began programming 7 years ago before I went back to college. I spent most of my time working with Java, and learning how to work with that. However these days and several computer science classes later, I not only know Java, but several other programming Languages as well. While I worked on several small projects, I have been able to practice my Java Skills with C# as they are a very similar language.
								Using C# has really helped me practice with Game development.
										<br><br>
								My current programming project is a 2D stealth based metroidvania that will take place in a cyberpunk word. This game is being built from the ground up in Unity, using C#. and several of the tools that I am using to build this Game are also being built with Python, due to its cross platform ability. I am an avid Linux enthusiast so that really helps me on my day to day work flow if I dont have to worry about what tool is working on what OS.
